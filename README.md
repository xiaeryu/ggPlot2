Plot options
---
First you should **[Create a plot](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/plotCreation.md)**. Whatever you want to plot, you need the **[Aesthetics](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/aesthetics.md)** to hlep you specify the data to plot and the feature to plot! **[Scale](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/scales.md)** is rather useful in adjust colors, axis and others.

Want others to know what you mean clearer? Turn to the **[Annotation](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/annotation.md)** where you can annotate with text, rectangle, segment, and many other options! **[Theme](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/themes.md)** offers a broader range of such options about the themes!

It is also helpful to know something about the **[Coordinate systems](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/coordinateSystems.md)**, about the **[Position adjustment](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/positionAdjustments.md)**, and about the **[Faceting](https://github.com/xiaeryu/ggPlot2/blob/master/faceting.md)** that is useful for displaying subsets of the dataset in different panels.
