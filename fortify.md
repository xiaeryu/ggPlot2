Fortify
====================
Fortify methods make it possible to use ggplot2 with objects of various types, not just data frames.

* **fortify**: Method to convert a generic R object into a data frame useful for plotting. 
Takes its name from the idea of fortifying the original data with model fit statistics, and vice versa.  
 fortify.lm: for linear regression objects
 fortify.map: for map objects

* **map_data**: Create a data frame of map data.
